Need to use glad.c core version with all extensions added. Compile glad.c with solution 
v2 soln now works

Radar sender/receiver functions works ok now, with the current functions. Seemed to be bad HW for servo 
for the servo whcih caused slow reading. For the radar plotter:
A hemisphere of 170 degrees

=========RADAR FUNCTION==========

This function will draw and continually update the radar on the screen. Will be three drawing objects.
One draws the background a hemishpere of 170 degrees. Will be in black.The vertices are constant for 
this(static). The radar will have its vertices updated by the serial (dynamic). The scale will be drawn over that. 
Scale goes from 0-2m and 0-170 degrees Will show measurement. 

*Background
Vetrices plan: Will start at center and the centre, so [0] is 0,0,0 (x,y,z). next point is 0.5,0,0 at 2m zero 
degrees. so scale is 2m ---> 0.5. 0m--> 0.0. Next point is n=cos(90-theta)*h where theta is angle from 0-170
degrees and h is 2m radius so h=0.5. 

*Radar
Vertices plan: Same as Background object. But the radius (h) is the value read by the radar serial as well as 
and theta is read from the serial. Whats drawn on the screen is a triagle with vertices point n= cos(90-theta)*h
and the point n-1 and the origin. The color of the triangle depends on the radius. with 2m being blue and 0m being 
Blue.Two look up tables 
 
*Scale
Verticesplan: WIll indicate at 10 degree intervals and from 0-50 cm ant 10cm intervals and 50-100 cm at 20 cm and
100-200cm at 0.4cm intervals.
 
Triangle genrator. The first index is n theta 5 and next is n at theta+1 and final n is the origin 0,0,0.  Where
n is a three digit  so
5-175 degrees so 170 triangles to draw. Iterations to load the vector is 170*3.

It needs work. 170 triangles to be drawn. 170*3 vertices and 170*3*3 points
Add a 000 on these iterations
1
4
7
10
13
16

Once the first is done, add every third iteration

Function to return a vector that has all cordinates to draw a hemisphere of specified angle and radius. Or could draw one
1 degree segment and thenuse a matrix transform to move it. use provided radius to draw.
Could draw a triangle and just translate it. But need to this for 170 sectors

The transform works on a shader instance. So, either 170+ shader programs are needed or 
the respective transformations need to be added to the vertices container fed into glBuffer().

Radar is OK. Two Vectors, one with radar angle, and radar position. The are read. Plots 0-175 degress, but updates the 
distance and so the scale 

Radar function sort of works now. Need firther testing. Need to adjust servo position such that 0 degrees is actually
the mechanical 0. Once this is done, need to setup test enviornment and verify radar map. need to creat class and genericfy
dunctions. 

=========ACCEL/GYRO FUNCTION==========

08/07
Pretty robust cccode on arduino for oreintation is available. Now need a better serial commonication betwwen ard an c++
code. For this, could be better to send a command to the arduino to first read a value and wait to receive. So, send 
a command to request for pitch. then ard sends pitch value. Then request for roll, ard will send roll. Need a function to read serial for
one byte. on the side of arduino.

D2 changed to 7

Int32 handles upto 10000

09/07
added a more robust serial transfer for pitch, yaw, roll. it can crash tho, need to know why. Seems like it crashes 
at a yaw value of about 85...

Frame buffers might be answer. Look into the the game class in Textbook

22/07
The BallObject is inherited from GameObject, GameObject uses an object of the SpriteRender class.
This class has the draw function. This is DrawSprite. TextRender class has its own draw functions.
Implemented a GraphicRender this will be DrawSprite equaivalent. The radar background + radar use 
different funtions to draw. Could have a parent Radar class, virtual, and then derive additional 
RadarBackground +Radar class and a RadarScale class. One radar class that will draw

31/07
Looking at the breakout game, the SpriteRenderer object Renderer is passed as an argument, so the 
VAO is initialized in the RenderInit function thats in the Rneder class, to theres is only one VAO
here

Try Graphicrender with Radar class

07/08
Using the graphic render class, seems like when the PrepareTextVS() is called, thats when the radar isnt rendered
Enabling face culling "glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE)" seems to not work with drawing the radar.
Now it seems to work

Use ulstra sound serial transfer as is, you need to request what you want to read and keep requesting until its gotten.
probs need to do the saem with position. As is, on the V2 and Ultra sound serial transfer function seems to work well. 

=======MOTOR STEERING=============

09/05
When sending a hard coded servo command in the case of STEERING_COMMAND, it still doesn't work. It seems like its not even getting
the correct command
