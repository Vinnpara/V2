Added working RadarUI, telemetryUI classes. Better to have both in a single UI class that will 
display radar and telem. This will have a serial object passed into it. Next step is to get a robust, 
fast radar and accel receiver. This UI could also handle robot commands, as serial object is already in it.

Working model in telemetry. Now need to implement predictive attitude function, radar on second board.
Now get to OpenCV stuff, and then, motor/steering

Accel_radar is the ard file to use, but need to use two boards seems like. because each iteration of the for loop 
of the arduino moves the radar servo by 1 deg and takes a measurement. If both gyro and radar serial tranfer is done here
using the switch case, if neither case is met it will not send the value and so it may explain why it "skips" radar pos and
reading values. Maybe have a function that loops thru the for loop until a command is sent. So the oder of sending/reiving:

	*Radar reading
	*Radar Pos
	*Pitch
	*Yaw
	*Roll
	*Acc-x
	*Acc-z
	*Acc-y

Essentially, keep trying until the certain value is sent. This may cause delays in the total iteration however.
